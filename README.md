# commons-data

This project leverages datanucleus to create a common data access layer for your project entities.
It optionally auto validates insert and updates.

Here is a quick description of the datanucleus project found at datanucleus.org:

The DataNucleus project provides products for the management of application data in a Java environment. DataNucleus provides open source (Apache 2 licensed) products supporting fully compliant data access using all standardised APIs (JDO, JPA) to a very wide-range of datastores (RDBMS, ODBMS, Map-based, Web-based, documents, etc) whilst supporting querying using a range of query languages. This flexibility of API and datastore is not available in any other persistence tool Since the API's are standard and so reasonably well-known this reduces the learner curve, and you can use the same API for all of your data. It's time to free up your data access layer
